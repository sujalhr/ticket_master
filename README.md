# Ticketmaster API Integration 

## Project Overview
This project creates a comprehensive system to extract and analyze event data from the Ticketmaster Discovery API using a hierarchical classification approach. It's designed to run in Google Colab with secure API key management and interactive data exploration capabilities.

## Project Flow

### 1. **Classification Data Extraction**
- **Purpose**: Build a complete taxonomy of event categories
- **Process**: 
  - Fetches all classifications from Ticketmaster API with pagination
  - Extracts hierarchical structure: Classifications → Segments → Genres → Subgenres
  - Creates ID-to-name mappings for easy lookup
  - Saves both raw and structured classification data

### 2. **Event Data Retrieval**
- **Purpose**: Get detailed event information using classification filters
- **Process**:
  - Uses segment/genre/subgenre IDs to filter events
  - Supports additional filters (location, date range, sorting)
  - Handles pagination to get comprehensive results
  - Processes raw event data into structured format

### 3. **Data Processing & Analysis**
- **Purpose**: Transform raw API responses into usable datasets
- **Features**:
  - Extracts key event details (name, date, venue, pricing)
  - Includes venue information (location, address)
  - Captures attraction/artist details
  - Maintains classification hierarchy links

## Use Cases

### **Business Intelligence**:
- Market analysis by event category
- Geographic distribution of events
- Pricing trends across different event types
- Venue utilization patterns

### **Event Discovery**:
- Find events by specific music genres
- Locate sports events in particular regions
- Discover entertainment options by category

### **Data Science Applications**:
- Event recommendation systems
- Demand forecasting
- Market segmentation analysis
- Location-based analytics
